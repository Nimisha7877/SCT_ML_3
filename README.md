# 🐱🐶 Cat vs. Dog Image Classifier using SVM

This project is a simple machine learning solution to classify images as either a **Cat** or a **Dog** using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). It demonstrates basic image preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training for beginners working with computer vision tasks.

## 📌 Objective

🔎 Build a machine learning model to classify images as either **Cat** or **Dog** using a Support Vector Machine (SVM), aiming to:

- Understand basic image classification workflows
- Practice image preprocessing techniques
- Evaluate model performance on real-world image data

## 🗂️ Dataset Details

- **Dataset Name:** PetImages
- **Source:** [Cat Vs Dog Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karakaggle/kaggle-cat-vs-dog-dataset)

### Folder Structure

| Folder / File Path                | Description               |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| PetImages/                        | Root folder for the dataset |
| PetImages/Cat/                    | Folder containing cat images |
| PetImages/Cat/cat_image1.jpg      | Example cat image file |
| PetImages/Cat/cat_image2.jpg      | Example cat image file |
| PetImages/Dog/                    | Folder containing dog images |
| PetImages/Dog/dog_image1.jpg      | Example dog image file |
| PetImages/Dog/dog_image2.jpg      | Example dog image file |

- Images vary in size and quality.
- Up to **500 images per class** are used for faster training.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Grayscale image conversion
- Image resizing to **64 × 64 pixels**
- Flattening images into 1D feature vectors
- Normalizing pixel values to range 0-1
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel
- Train-test split (80% train, 20% test)
- Model evaluation using accuracy and classification report
